### Hi there ðŸ˜ƒ

I'm a PhD student in Astronomy at Heidelberg University. Here you find the code that I wrote for my thesis project

* [pnlf](https://github.com/fschmnn/pnlf): measure the Planetary Nebulae Luminosity Function for 19 galaxies observed by PHANGS--MUSE.
* [gas-around-stars](https://github.com/fschmnn/gas-around-stars): connect HII regions to the source of the ionizing radiation, i.e. massive star clusters.
* [astrotools](https://github.com/fschmnn/astrotools): functions that I deemed useful and use in multiple projects.
* [sitelle](https://github.com/fschmnn/sitelle): measure the [OII] line from SITELLE data, useful for metallicity prescriptions.

I am also a bit of a LaTeX enthusiast. Here are some projects one might find useful: 

* [biblatex-mnras](https://github.com/fschmnn/biblatex-mnras): emulate the MNRAS bibliography style in biblatex.
* [pyTeX](https://github.com/fschmnn/pyTeX): stylesheet to create beautiful figures in matplotlib that integrate seamlessly in LaTeX.
* [thesis-template](https://github.com/fschmnn/thesis-template): a thesis template (not up-to-date).

Other stuff:

* [duodecimal](https://github.com/fschmnn/duodecimal): base 12 is superior to base 10. This python package allows for easy conversion.
* [cellular-automata](https://github.com/fschmnn/cellular-automata): create fun animations of cellular automata. 
* [circle-of-parity](https://github.com/fschmnn/circle-of-parity): find a circle of parity based on NFL games.
